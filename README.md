# About me
Heya, I'm ashlen, a programmer living in Czech Republic. I'm currently a student and code as a hobby. I mostly make downloaders and API wrappers. In my free time I do amateur linguistics and play videogames.

If you want to contact me or ask me any questions, the best way is through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/454513969265115137) (`@ashleney`). I most likely won't take any friends so just join [my support server](https://discord.gg/sMkSKRPuCR). 

I'm nonbinary.
